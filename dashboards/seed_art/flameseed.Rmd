```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(learnr)
```

The two exercises below use the [flametree](https://github.com/djnavarro/flametree) [aRt](https://github.com/djnavarro) package written by by [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/).

Try changing the `seed` argument to grow your own unique flametree.

```{r flameseed, exercise = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(flametree)
flametree <- flametree_grow(seed = 2020)
flametree_plot(tree = flametree)  
```

Try changing some of the other arguments too; see if you can work out what they do!

```{r flame, exercise = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(flametree)
flametree <- flametree_grow(seed = 2020, time = 3, split = 5) 
flametree_plot(tree = flametree)  
```
