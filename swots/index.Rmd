# Preface {-}

A collection of (MWE) worksheets illustrating some fundamental #rstats and #biostats concepts. These sheets are meant as (fun) worked examples; they are **not** meant as comprehensive teaching materials. The worked examples, alongside the provided data, can be used as *optional* or *extra* casestudies to illustrate the concepts and familiarise students with the approaches outwith course materials.
