# Animating Acronyms
```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

Inspired by the paper, [Meta-Research: The growth of acronyms in the scientific literature](https://elifesciences.org/articles/60080) (radio interview [here](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2018760724/from-dna-to-rna-science-s-unhealthy-obsession-with-acronyms)), we'll use `gganimate` to create an animation of the top twenty [acronyms used in the titles of scientific publications](https://github.com/agbarnett/acronyms) 1900--2019 (see similar [animation here](https://github.com/agbarnett/acronyms/tree/master/animation)).

If you want download and wrangle to data yourself then feel free to use [this `R` script](https://github.com/cmjt/statbiscuits/blob/master/swots/raw-scripts/raw_acronym.r); however for simplicity we'll download the data we'll need directly from GitHub. 

```{r get data, eval = FALSE}
data_url <- "https://github.com/cmjt/statbiscuits/raw/master/swots/data/top_twenty.RData"

load(url(data_url))
```

```{r sneakdata, echo = FALSE}
load("data/top_twenty.RData")
```

## Data exploration

The `R` object we've loaded, named `top_twenty`, is a list of length `r length(top_twenty)`, where each element contains a `data.frame` for each year with the following `r ncol(top_twenty)` variables: **`r colnames(top_twenty[[1]])`**.

The name of each element in the list indicate the year of publication.

```{r look}
names(top_twenty)
```

The column **`r colnames(top_twenty[[1]])[2]`** contains the top-twenty acronym used in the title of a publication in **`r colnames(top_twenty[[1]])[5]`** identified by **`r colnames(top_twenty[[1]])[1]`** and **`r colnames(top_twenty[[1]])[13]`**. The number of characters in an acronym are given in the **`r colnames(top_twenty[[1]])[3]`** column. Other information relating to the published article is given in the other columns.

```{r look2}
head(top_twenty[[1]])
```


As you can imagine for the top-twenty acronyms alone there are thousands of observations each year:

```{r look3}
sapply(top_twenty, nrow)
```
Let's look at the top-twenty acronyms in `r names(top_twenty)[1]`:

```{r tabs}
table(top_twenty[[1]]$acronyms)
```

## Format the data to suit our porposes

A long list probably isn't the best way to summarise these data
 - We could combine all the elements into one big `dataframe` (remember we have already have a column specifying year)
 
```{r df}
library(dplyr)
df <- bind_rows(top_twenty)
head(df)
```

Let's count the acronyms
 
```{r count}
count <- df %>% count(acronyms)
head(count)
```

Not quite what we want, we forgot to group by year...
 
```{r countbyyear}
count <- df %>% group_by(Year) %>% count(acronyms)
head(count)
```

Now let's sort by the most used by year and rank

```{r rankbyyear}
ranked <- count %>%
  arrange(Year, -n) %>%
  mutate(rank = as.factor(1:n()))
head(ranked)
```



## Plotting

Numbers of each acronym by year

```{r gg}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ranked, aes(x = Year, y = n, col = acronyms)) + geom_line() 
```

Quite a lot going on... What about a bar graph so we can easily compare acronyms? One thing to note is that as we've already "counted" the acronyms then we need to specify `stat = "identity"` in our call to `geom_bar()` so that `ggplot()` knows to use our data as bar heights. Note also that we can flip `x = ` and `y = ` inside `aes()` to switch the axes.
 
```{r bar1}
ggplot(ranked, aes(x = n, y = rank, fill = acronyms)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

We've forgotten about year

  - what about using `facet_wrap()`?
  
The colours are awful

  - how about a decent palette (e.g., `scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")`)? See others [here](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/the-a-z-of-rcolorbrewer-palette/).
  
The trouble with the `"Dark2"` palette from `RColorBrewer` is that it only contains 8 different colours and we need 54! No problem we can simply extend the colour palette using the `colorRampPalette()` function from `ColorBrewer`:
  
```{r cols}
## We need 54 colours as there are 54 unique acronyms
library(RColorBrewer)
n.cols <- 54
mycols <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))(n.cols)
head(mycols)
```

So, we use `facet_wrap()` to create a multi panel plot (splitting by `Year`) and `scale_fill_manual()` to specify our chosen (better) colour palette for the `fill` aesthetic.

```{r bar3, fig.width = 10,fig.height = 8}
ggplot(ranked, aes(x = n, y = rank, fill = acronyms)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Year) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mycols)
```

Well there's quite a lot going on there; let's let the axes differ for each year as 
  - not all counts are the same, and 
  - not all acronyms turn up each year.
We can use `scales = "free"` in our `facet_wrap()` call for this.

```{r rank1, fig.width = 10,fig.height = 8}
ggplot(ranked, aes(x = n, y = rank, fill = acronyms)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Year, scales = "free") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mycols)
```

There are a number of issues with this plot; let's sort a few of them out:

  - using `geom_text()` we'll label each bar by the acronym it represents and left justify
  this text, `hjust = "left"`
  - we'll suppress the x- and y-axis labels using `xlab("")` and `ylab("")` (is there good reason to do this?)
  - we'll change the theme to `theme_gray()`, other options discussed [here](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/ggplot-themes-gallery/)
  - in addition to the theme we choose we may want to fine tune some other elements so using `theme()` we'll suppress the y-axis ticks and labels with `axis.text.y = element_blank(),axis.ticks.y = element_blank()` and scrap the needless legend using `legend.position = "none"`. Remember we have the acronym labels now!
  - finally, to reverse the order of the factor ranks, 1...20, we use `scale_y_discrete()` so that 1 is on top

```{r rank2, fig.width = 15,fig.height = 13}
plot <- ggplot(ranked, aes(x = n, y = rank, fill = acronyms)) +
          geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
          facet_wrap(~Year, scales = "free") +
          scale_fill_manual(values = mycols) +
          geom_text(aes(label = acronyms), hjust = "left", col = "darkgrey") +
          xlab("") + ylab("") + 
          theme_gray() +
          theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),legend.position = "none") +
          scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(levels(ranked$rank)))

plot
```


There's still a lot going on! So let's us `gganimate` to create a racing barchart!

It's as simple as adding ` + transition_time()`! Although we do have to use `facet_null()` to forget the `facet_wrap()` stuff (for reasons only ggplot2 wizards know). Let's also add a title specifying year using `labs()`.

```{r gganimate1,eval = FALSE}
library(gganimate)
anim <- plot +  
  transition_time(Year) +
  facet_null()  + ## we have to forget facet stuff for reasons only ggplot2 wizards know
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}") 
anim
```
